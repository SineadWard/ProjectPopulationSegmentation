    "# Population Segmentation with SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll employ two, unsupervised learning algorithms to do **population segmentation**. Population segmentation aims to find natural groupings in population data that reveal some feature-level similarities between different regions in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **principal component analysis** (PCA) you will reduce the dimensionality of the original census data. Then, you'll use **k-means clustering** to assign each US county to a particular cluster based on where a county lies in component space. How each cluster is arranged in component space can tell you which US counties are most similar and what demographic traits define that similarity; this information is most often used to inform targeted, marketing campaigns that want to appeal to a specific group of people. This cluster information is also useful for learning more about a population by revealing patterns between regions that you otherwise may not have noticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### US Census Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be using data collected by the [US Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census), which aims to count the US population, recording demographic traits about labor, age, population, and so on, for each county in the US. The bulk of this notebook was taken from an existing SageMaker example notebook and [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/analyze-us-census-data-for-population-segmentation-using-amazon-sagemaker/), and I've broken it down further into demonstrations and exercises for you to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement population segmentation, you'll go through a number of steps:\n",
    "* Data loading and exploration\n",
    "* Data cleaning and pre-processing \n",
    "* Dimensionality reduction with PCA\n",
    "* Feature engineering and data transformation\n",
    "* Clustering transformed data with k-means\n",
    "* Extracting trained model attributes and visualizing k clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks make up a complete, machine learning workflow from data loading and cleaning to model deployment. Each exercise is designed to give you practice with part of the machine learning workflow, and to demonstrate how to use SageMaker tools, such as built-in data management with S3 and built-in algorithms.\n",

    "In general, you can see that features come in a variety of ranges, mostly percentages from 0-100, and counts that are integer values in a large range. Let's visualize the data in some of our feature columns and see what the distribution, over all counties, looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below cell displays **histograms**, which show the distribution of data points over discrete feature ranges. The x-axis represents the different bins; each bin is defined by a specific range of values that a feature can take, say between the values 0-5 and 5-10, and so on. The y-axis is the frequency of occurrence or the number of county data points that fall into each bin. I find it helpful to use the y-axis values for relative comparisons between different features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I'm plotting a histogram comparing methods of commuting to work over all of the counties. I just copied these feature names from the list of column names, printed above. I also know that all of these features are represented as percentages (%) in the original data, so the x-axes of these plots will be comparable."

    "Our current PCA model creates 33 principal components, but when we create new dimensionality-reduced training data, we'll only select a few, top n components to use. To decide how many top components to include, it's helpful to look at how much **data variance** the components capture. For our original, high-dimensional data, 34 features captured 100% of our data variance. If we discard some of these higher dimensions, we will lower the amount of variance we can capture.\n",

    "As an illustrative example, say we have original data in three dimensions. So, three dimensions capture 100% of our data variance; these dimensions cover the entire spread of our data. The below images are taken from the PhD thesis,  [“Approaches to analyse and interpret biological profile data”](https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/docId/696) by Matthias Scholz, (2006, University of Potsdam, Germany).\n",

    "Now, you may also note that most of this data seems related; it falls close to a 2D plane, and just by looking at the spread of the data, we  can visualize that the original, three dimensions have some correlation. So, we can instead choose to create two new dimensions, made up of linear combinations of the original, three dimensions. These dimensions are represented by the two axes/lines, centered in the data. \n",

    "<img src='notebook_ims/pca_2d_dim_reduction.png' width=70% />\n",

    "If we project this in a new, 2D space, we can see that we still capture most of the original data variance using *just* two dimensions. There is a tradeoff between the amount of variance we can capture and the number of component-dimensions we use to represent our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we select the top n components to use in a new data model, we'll typically want to include enough components to capture about 80-90% of the original data variance. In this project, we are looking at generalizing over a lot of data and we'll aim for about 80% coverage."

    "You have just walked through a machine learning workflow for unsupervised learning, specifically, for clustering a dataset using k-means after reducing the dimensionality using PCA. By accessing the underlying models created within  SageMaker, you were able to improve the explainability of your model and draw insights from the resultant clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these techniques, you have been able to better understand the essential characteristics of different counties in the US and segment them into similar groups, accordingly."
